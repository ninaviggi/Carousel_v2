# Carousel_v2

It took me about 28 hours. Started over multiple times, dissected other people's codes, worked alongside classmates, 
rewatched many demos.Still a bit slow but slowly getting the hang of it. 

Completed: 
Static photo tiles on the initial screen

Tapping on email/password reveals the keyboard and shifts the scrollview and Sign In button up.
If the username or password fields are empty, user sees an error alert.
